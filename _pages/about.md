Hello, and welcome to my portfolio page! It doesn't matter who you are or why you are here, but I do hope by browsing through this website, you can learn more about me. 

Here's a quick introduction in case you don't know about me yet: I am a first generation Bachelor's Degree student studying Computer Engineering in University of Virginia, and expected to graduate in 2025. I have a very deep interest that spread across the whole computer-related field. I have experiences ranging from software engineering, hardware engineering to embedded engineering, system engineering and more. Beside tackling with computer systems, I also have a strong interest in mechanics. My main field of interests includes but not limit to Robotics, mechatronics, automotive engineering, ADAS/autonomous vehicles, embedded development and software engineering.

There are three teachers in my family of five, and I defineately kept this trend going. I have been teaching as a teaching assistant in the computer science department for two course over the course of two years. I enjoy helping others and I feel so achieved whenevere I solve a student's question.

Besides working and studying, I do have lots of other hobbies. I like cars a lot since I was in a young age. I enjoy the car culture and I like go to car meets and chat with different people. I also like tinkering with my car. I do electronic retrofits and also some mechanic jobs as well. I often record my process of doing these works and post them as tutorials on social media.
I am also a music producer. I have been producing music for more than 6 years, with genres ranging from pop/rock to hardcore electronic music. I often help others by providing copyright-free music for others to use in their videos, games, and other projects. I enjoying making creative kind of music that stands out on its own.
